# ML-ethanol-optimization

## Description 
This repository represents machine learning (ML) script used in the publication ""

Overall, we used XGBoost to train the model for predicting ethanol production in the combinatorial yeasts. 

We searched for suitable ML algorithms uisng the caret package, and XGBoost was usd for comprehensive model training.

All analysis were performed under R version 4.1.1

## Data availability
Raw data required for analysis are deposited in this repository and in supplementary materials in the publication.
